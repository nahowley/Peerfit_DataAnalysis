## Reservation Data Analysis Project Questionnaire

### Project Data Points
1. Across all reservation partners for January & February, how many completed reservations occurred?

2. Which studio has the highest rate of reservation abandonment (did not cancel but did not check-in)?

3. Which fitness area (i.e., tag) has the highest number of completed reservations for February?

4. How many members completed at least 1 reservation and had no more than 1 cancelled reservation in January?

5. At what time of day do most users book classes? Attend classes? (Morning = 7-11 AM, Afternoon = 12-4 PM, Evening = 5-10 PM)

6. How many confirmed completed reservations did the member (ID) with the most reserved classes in February have?

7. Write a query that unions the `mindbody_reservations` table and `clubready_reservations` table as cleanly as possible.

### Project Discussion
1. What opportunities do you see to improve data storage and standardization for these datasets?

2. What forecasting opportunities do you see with a dataset like this and why?

3. What other data would you propose we gather to make reporting/forecasting more robust and why?
